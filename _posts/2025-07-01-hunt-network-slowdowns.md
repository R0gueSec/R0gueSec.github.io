# üîç Overview

>The server team has noticed a significant network performance degradation on some of their older devices attached to the network in the 10.0.0.0/16 network. After ruling out external DDoS attacks, the security team suspects something might be going on internally.
> Machine Threat-Hunting- was found failing several connection requests against windows-target-1 and another host on the same network

## Tools Used
- **Cloud Platform:** Azure
- **EDR:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- **SIEM:** Microsoft Sentinel
- **VM:** Windows 10

## Scenario 2: Sudden Network Slowdowns

Machine Threat-Hunting- was found failing several connection requests against windows-target-1 and another host on the same network:

```bash
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where ActionType == "ConnectionFailed"
| summarize ConnectionCount = count() by DeviceName, ActionType, LocalIP, RemoteIP
| order by ConnectionCount
```

Observe total failed connections for a specific IP Address against other IPs

```bash
// Observe total failed connections for a specific IP Address against other IPs
let IPInQuestion = "10.1.0.74";
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where ActionType == "ConnectionFailed"
| where LocalIP == IPInQuestion
| summarize FailedConnectionsAttempts = count() by DeviceName, ActionType, LocalIP
| order by FailedConnectionsAttempts desc

```

Observe all failed connections for the IP in question.

```bash
// Observe all failed connections for the IP in question.
let IPInQuestion = "10.1.0.74";
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where ActionType == "ConnectionFailed"
| where LocalIP == IPInQuestion
| order by Timestamp desc

let VMName = "threat-hunting-";
let specificTime = datetime(2025-06-29T00:19:35.7246451Z);

After observing failed conection requests from our suspected host (10.1.0.74) in chronological order, I noticed a port scan was taking place due to the sequential order of the ports. There were several port scans being conducted 

I logged into the suspected computer and observed the PowerShell script that was used to conduct the port scan.

I searched for ‚Äúportscan‚Äù and found the account name that ran portscan.ps1

```powershell

let specificTime = datetime(2025-06-29T00:19:35.7246451Z);

| order by Timestamp desc
| project Timestamp, FileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, AccountName
```

We observed the port scan script that was launched by the rogueuser account. This is not expected behavior from that account and was not something set up by administrators, so I isolated the device, and ran a malware scan. 

![image.png](/assets/img/bluelabs/sudden-network-slowdowns/image12.png)

The malware scan produced no results, so out of caution, we kept the device isolated and put in a ticket to have it re-imaged and rebuilt. 

# MITRE ATT&CK Framework Related TTPs

Based on your detailed threat hunting observations, here are the relevant **MITRE ATT&CK Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)** associated with the activity:

---

### üß† **Key Behaviors Identified**

- A rogue account (`rogueuser`) ran a custom PowerShell port scanning script (`portscan.ps1`).
- Multiple sequential connection failures to internal hosts were observed.
- The scan was stealthy in nature (no multithreading), likely intended to avoid detection.
- The device was isolated and scanned for malware (no malware detected).

---

### üéØ **MITRE ATT&CK Mappings**

### **1. Tactic: Discovery (TA0007)**

**Technique: Network Service Scanning (T1046)**

- The PowerShell script explicitly scans a list of common ports on internal IPs to determine which services are exposed.
- The sequential nature of failed connections is consistent with manual or scripted scanning behavior.

### **2. Tactic: Execution (TA0002)**

**Technique: Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell (T1059.001)**

- The attacker used a PowerShell script to execute the scanning logic.
- `Test-NetConnection` and logging functions were invoked through a PowerShell command line.

### **3. Tactic: Credential Access (TA0006)** *(potentially, depending on further activity)*

**Technique: Valid Accounts (T1078)**

- The use of the `rogueuser` account to run the script suggests the possibility of **compromised or misused credentials**, especially since this behavior was not approved.

### **4. Tactic: Defense Evasion (TA0005)** *(conditional/optional)*

**Technique: Masquerading (T1036)**

- If the `portscan.ps1` script or its logs were made to appear like legitimate admin scripts (e.g., logging to `C:\ProgramData`), it may indicate basic evasion techniques.

# Mitigations

## üõ°Ô∏è **1. Preventive Controls**

### üîê **Account and Identity Hardening**

- **Restrict local admin rights**: Ensure that the `rogueuser` account (and others like it) have only the minimum privileges required.
- **Enforce strong authentication**: Use MFA for all privileged accounts.
- **Monitor for lateral movement credentials**: Disable unused accounts and enforce password hygiene.

### üßæ **Script and Execution Controls**

- **Constrain PowerShell usage**:
    - Enable **Constrained Language Mode** for untrusted users.
    - Use **AppLocker** or **Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC)** to **block unauthorized PowerShell scripts** like `portscan.ps1`.
- **Disable PowerShell V2** if not needed: It lacks important security logging and is often abused by attackers.

### üåê **Network Controls**

- **Segment internal networks**: Apply strict firewall rules between subnets to reduce the impact of lateral scans.
- **Limit ICMP and port access** between workstations: Prevent Test-NetConnection from being effective across segments.

---

## üîç **2. Detective Controls**

### üß≠ **Monitoring and Threat Hunting**

- **Log and alert on PowerShell execution**:
    - Enable **PowerShell Script Block Logging** and **Module Logging** in Group Policy.
    - Look for `Test-NetConnection`, `ForEach`, or custom script references like `portscan.ps1`.
- **Detect internal port scanning**:
    - Create detection rules for **high volumes of connection failures** in a short time frame.
    - Alert when **sequential ports** or **multiple hosts** are targeted from a single endpoint.

### üìä **Sample Sentinel Analytics Rule (KQL)**

```
kql
CopyEdit
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where ActionType == "ConnectionFailed"
| summarize FailedCount = count(), DistinctPorts = dcount(RemotePort), DistinctHosts = dcount(RemoteIP)
    by DeviceName, bin(Timestamp, 10m)
| where FailedCount > 100 and DistinctPorts > 10 and DistinctHosts > 5

```

---

## üîß **3. Corrective and Recovery Actions**

### üßº **Incident Response**

- **Isolate and reimage** the compromised device.
- **Revoke credentials** associated with the `rogueuser` account and force password resets for other potentially exposed accounts.

### üìÅ **Post-Mortem & Lessons Learned**

- Conduct a **root cause analysis** to determine:
    - Was the account compromised or misused?
    - Did the attacker gain persistence or try to exfiltrate data?
- Implement a **SOAR (Security Orchestration Automation and Response)** playbook to respond faster to similar patterns.

---

## üß∞ **Recommended Tooling**

- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)**: Can block suspicious PowerShell and log detailed activity.
- **Sysmon**: For rich endpoint logging, especially around script execution.
- **Azure Sentinel / Microsoft Sentinel**: Centralize and correlate logs with behavioral analytics.

## ‚úÖ **Summary Table**

| Layer | Control | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Endpoint | AppLocker / WDAC | Block unapproved scripts |
| Identity | Least privilege + MFA | Prevent misuse of accounts |
| Network | Segmentation + internal firewall rules | Limit scanning surface |
| Logging | PowerShell logging + MDE + Sentinel alerts | Detect script execution and port scans |
| Response | Isolation + reimaging + account revocation | Contain and remediate threats |
