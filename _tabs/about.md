# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I'm **RogueSec**, a cybersecurity practitioner with a focus on both offensive and defensive security. I blend hands-on red teaming, threat detection, cloud, and AI. My goal is to make cybersecurity more accessible and actionable â€” whether in blue team operations or adversary simulation.

Iâ€™m currently building **roguesec.net**, a portfolio and knowledge-sharing site where I publish labs, tools, notes, and content from my work and training.
