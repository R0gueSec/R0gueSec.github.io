# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I'm **David Marrufo**, a cybersecurity practitioner with a focus on both offensive and defensive security. I blend hands-on red teaming, threat detection, and threat intelligence with a background in education and pedagogy. My goal is to make cybersecurity more accessible and actionable â€” whether in blue team operations or adversary simulation.

Iâ€™m currently building **RogueSec**, a portfolio and knowledge-sharing site where I publish labs, tools, notes, and content from my work and training.
