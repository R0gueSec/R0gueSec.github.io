  Hi, RogueSec is the name and Penetration Testing is my game. After completing the Certified Penetration Tester (CPTS) certification from Hack the Box, I decided to showcase all my accomplishments and work so far on one page. If you are a hiring manager, recruiter, or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via email.

          Command Injection payloads for Linux and Windows
        description: |
          This project includes various lists of commands to inject into vulnerable web applications hosted on either Linux or Windows. The commands are separated into distinct payloads to facilitate differing stages of testing for Command Injections. Some payloads allow for testing of the 'whoami' command, while others allow attackers to test for various obfuscations of spaces or operators. My personal favorites are the Operators-Base64-* payloads, which allow an attacker to inject any command simply by using a Base64-encoded version of the command and using it in the payload. I have found that this technique is the jackpot of Command Injection attacks.

          A set of scripts to install common, but not default, penetration testing tools in Kali Linux
        description: |
          This set of scripts installs penetration testing tools that are not installed by default in Kali Linux and organizes the tools into folders. These scripts come in handy when installing a fresh version of Kali Linux, including when accidentally breaking your Kali VM (which of course has never happened to any of us).
