  Hi, RogueSec is the name and Penetration Testing is my game. After completing certifications like CPTS and BTL1 (Gold Coin Honors), I’ve built this portfolio to showcase my certifications, blue and red team lab work, and custom-built tooling. If you’re interested in exploring my investigations, attack simulations, or Python tooling, check out the Labs, Red Team Labs, or Tools pages above.
