  Hi, RogueSec is the name and Penetration Testing is my game. After completing the Certified Penetration Tester (CPTS) certification from Hack the Box, I decided to showcase all my accomplishments and work so far on one page. If you are a hiring manager, recruiter, or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via email.

  ðŸ‘‰ Check out my Blue Team Labs here: [www.roguesec.net/labs](https://www.roguesec.net/labs)
