  Hi, I go by the name RogueSec and I'm a Penetration Tester. After completing the Certified Penetration Tester (CPTS) certification from Hack the Box, I decided to showcase all my accomplishments and work so far on one page.

          Command Injection payloads for Linux and Windows
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This project includes various lists of commands to inject into vulnerable web applications hosted on either Linux or Windows. The commands are separated into distinct payloads to facilitate differing stages of testing for Command Injections. Some payloads allow for testing of the <mark>whoami</mark> command, while others allow attackers to test for various obfuscations of spaces or operators. My personal favorites are the <mark>Operators-Base64-*</mark> payloads, which allow an attacker to inject any command simply by using a Base64-encoded version of the command and using it in the payload. I have found that this technique is the jackpot of Command Injection attacks.

          A set of scripts to install common, but not default, penetration testing tools in Kali Linux
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This set of scripts installs penetration testing tools that are not installed by default in Kali Linux and organizes the tools into folders. These scripts come in handy when installing a fresh version of Kali Linux, including when accidentally breaking your Kali VM (which of course has never happened to any of us).

          Established in 1636, Harvard is the oldest higher education institution in the United States, and is widely regarded in terms of its influence, reputation, and academic pedigree as a leading university in not just the US but also the world.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at university and learnt a lot about a healthy work-life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
